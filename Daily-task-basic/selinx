1. Install SELinux (if not already installed)
For CentOS 7 / 8 / Stream, run:
sudo yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils
For CentOS Stream 9 / RHEL 9-based systems:
sudo dnf install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils
Verify installation:
rpm -qa | grep selinux

2. Check SELinux Current Mode
To see the current mode:
getenforce
Possible outputs:
Enforcing → SELinux is active and enforcing policy.
Permissive → SELinux is logging violations but not enforcing.
Disabled → SELinux is turned off.

3.Temporarily Disable SELinux
To disable SELinux without rebooting, use:
sudo setenforce 0
Verify:
getenforce
Output should show:
Permissive
⚠️ This change is temporary — it will revert after reboot.

4.Permanently Disable SELinux
To disable SELinux permanently:
Open the SELinux configuration file:
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
Locate the following line:
SELINUX=enforcing
Change it to:
SELINUX=disabled
Save and exit (Esc, then :wq).
